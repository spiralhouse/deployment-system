## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v18 or later
- npm v7 or later

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This will automatically set up Git hooks for commit message validation.

### Git Hooks
This project uses Git hooks to ensure code quality and consistency:

- **commit-msg**: Validates commit messages follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification
  - Subject line must be 72 characters or less
  - Body lines must be 100 characters or less
  - Must use valid commit types (feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore)

To bypass hooks in exceptional cases (not recommended), use:
```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "your message"
```

### Commit Message Format
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

Example:
```
feat(api): add endpoint for deployment status

Add new REST endpoint for querying deployment status across
multiple clusters. Includes support for filtering and sorting.

Closes #123
```
