# Deployment System Use Cases

This document outlines the key use cases that the deployment system needs to address.

## Overview

The deployment system is designed to handle application deployment scenarios, from single-service deployments to coordinated multi-service deployments. The system focuses on managing the deployment lifecycle of applications and services, including validation, execution, monitoring, and rollback capabilities. Infrastructure management is handled by separate Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools and is outside the scope of this system.

Each use case represents a specific scenario that the system must support, with a focus on:
- Application and service deployment coordination
- Environment configuration management
- Deployment validation and verification
- Rollback operations
- Multi-service deployment orchestration

## Use Cases

### 1. Application Deployment
- **Description**: Deploy a new version of an application to a target environment
- **Actors**: Developers, DevOps engineers
- **Preconditions**: 
  - Application code is ready for deployment
  - Target environment is configured
  - Required credentials and permissions are available
- **Main Flow**:
  1. Developer initiates deployment
  2. System validates deployment configuration
  3. System executes deployment steps
  4. System verifies deployment success
  5. System notifies relevant stakeholders
- **Postconditions**: Application is successfully deployed and running

### 2. Rollback Operations
- **Description**: Revert a deployment or infrastructure change
- **Actors**: DevOps engineers, Operations team
- **Preconditions**:
  - Previous state is available
  - Rollback is authorized
- **Main Flow**:
  1. Engineer initiates rollback
  2. System identifies previous state
  3. System executes rollback steps
  4. System verifies rollback
  5. System notifies stakeholders
- **Postconditions**: System is restored to previous state

### 3. Environment Synchronization
- **Description**: Synchronize configuration across environments
- **Actors**: DevOps engineers
- **Preconditions**:
  - Source environment is identified
  - Target environments are configured
- **Main Flow**:
  1. Engineer selects source environment
  2. System identifies differences
  3. System applies synchronization
  4. System verifies synchronization
- **Postconditions**: Environments are synchronized

### 4. Deployment Validation
- **Description**: Validate deployment configuration and readiness
- **Actors**: Developers, DevOps engineers
- **Preconditions**:
  - Deployment configuration is available
  - Target environment is accessible
- **Main Flow**:
  1. Engineer requests validation
  2. System checks configuration
  3. System verifies dependencies
  4. System reports validation results
- **Postconditions**: Deployment configuration is validated

### 5. Coordinated Multi-Service Deployment
- **Description**: Deploy multiple interdependent services in a coordinated manner with atomic rollback
- **Actors**: DevOps engineers, Release managers
- **Preconditions**:
  - All services are ready for deployment
  - Service dependencies are defined
  - Deployment order is specified
  - Required permissions are available
- **Main Flow**:
  1. Engineer defines deployment group and dependencies
  2. System validates all service configurations
  3. System executes deployments in specified order
  4. System monitors health of each service
  5. If any service fails:
     - System initiates coordinated rollback
     - System reverts all services to previous state
     - System notifies stakeholders of failure
  6. If all services succeed:
     - System verifies service interactions
     - System notifies stakeholders of success
- **Postconditions**: 
  - All services are successfully deployed and interacting correctly, or
  - All services are rolled back to their previous state
- **Failure Handling**:
  - System must maintain transaction-like behavior
  - Rollback must be atomic across all services
  - System must preserve service state during rollback
  - System must provide detailed failure analysis

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Deployment operations should complete within defined time limits
- System should handle multiple concurrent deployments
- Validation operations should be fast and efficient

### Security
- All operations must be authenticated and authorized
- Sensitive information must be encrypted
- Audit logs must be maintained

### Reliability
- System must handle failures gracefully
- Critical operations must be idempotent
- System must maintain consistency across environments

### Scalability
- System must support growing number of environments
- System must handle increasing deployment complexity
- System must scale with team size

## Future Considerations

As the system evolves, additional use cases may be identified and added to this document. The system should be designed to accommodate new use cases while maintaining its core functionality and principles.
