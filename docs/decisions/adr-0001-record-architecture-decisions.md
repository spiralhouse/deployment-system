# ADR-0001: Record Architecture Decisions

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project to provide context for future team members and to ensure that we don't revisit decisions without good reason.

## Decision
We will use Architecture Decision Records, as described by Michael Nygard in [this article](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

Each ADR will be stored in the `docs/decisions` directory as a markdown file. The ADR will be named using the format `adr-NNNN-title.md` where `NNNN` is a sequential number and `title` is a short hyphenated name.

## Consequences
- Team members can see the ADRs in the repository and understand what decisions have been made and why.
- The motivation behind previous decisions is visible.
- The time spent discussing alternatives will be documented.
- Future changes will be made with full understanding of the consequences.

## Compliance
- All significant architectural decisions must be documented as ADRs.
- ADRs should be reviewed by at least one other team member before being accepted.
- ADRs can be superseded but should not be deleted.
