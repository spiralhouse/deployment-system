# ADR-0004: Programming Language and Framework Selection

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The deployment system needs a robust, scalable foundation that can handle complex deployment operations, concurrent tasks, and system-level interactions. The choice of programming language and framework will significantly impact development speed, operational characteristics, and long-term maintainability.

Key requirements:
- High performance for concurrent operations
- Strong system-level programming capabilities
- Rich ecosystem for deployment-related tools
- Good developer experience
- Strong security features
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Active community and long-term support

## Decision
We will use **Rust** as our primary programming language with the following key frameworks and libraries:

### Core Framework Stack:
- **Tokio**: Async runtime for handling concurrent operations
- **Axum**: Web framework for API development
- **SQLx**: Database access with compile-time verification
- **Serde**: Serialization/deserialization
- **Tracing**: Observability and logging
- **Clap**: Command-line argument parsing

### Rationale for Rust:
1. **Performance & Safety**
   - Zero-cost abstractions
   - Memory safety without garbage collection
   - Thread safety guarantees
   - High performance comparable to C/C++

2. **Ecosystem**
   - Strong container and deployment libraries
   - Excellent async support
   - Rich security-focused crates
   - Growing cloud provider SDKs

3. **Developer Experience**
   - Strong type system
   - Excellent error handling
   - Great IDE support (rust-analyzer)
   - Comprehensive testing framework
   - Clear documentation

4. **Operational Benefits**
   - Single binary deployment
   - Minimal runtime dependencies
   - Excellent cross-platform support
   - Built-in concurrency safety

5. **Security**
   - Memory safety by default
   - Thread safety guarantees
   - Strong type system prevents many runtime errors
   - Active security-focused community

6. **Long-term Viability**
   - Backed by Mozilla and growing industry support
   - Active community and rapid growth
   - Strong commitment to stability
   - Clear upgrade paths

### Alternative Options Considered:

1. **Go**
   - Pros:
     - Simple concurrency model
     - Fast compilation
     - Good standard library
   - Cons:
     - Less type safety
     - Garbage collection overhead
     - Fewer compile-time guarantees

2. **Python**
   - Pros:
     - Rich ecosystem
     - Easy to learn
     - Great for prototyping
   - Cons:
     - Performance limitations
     - Dynamic typing risks
     - GIL limitations for concurrency
     - Dependency management complexity

3. **Java/Kotlin**
   - Pros:
     - Mature ecosystem
     - Strong enterprise support
     - Good performance
   - Cons:
     - JVM overhead
     - Complex deployment
     - Less suitable for system programming

## Consequences
- Team members will need to learn Rust if not already familiar
- Initial development might be slower due to Rust's learning curve
- Need to carefully manage dependencies and versioning
- Must establish clear coding standards for Rust
- Will need to invest in Rust-specific CI/CD tooling
- May need to write some system-level code in C for specific platforms

## Compliance
- All new code must be written in Rust
- External dependencies must be carefully vetted
- Regular security audits of dependencies required
- Performance benchmarks must be maintained
- Documentation must be kept up to date with code changes
- Regular updates to Rust toolchain and dependencies
