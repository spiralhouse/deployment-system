# ADR-0004: Programming Language and Framework Selection

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The deployment system needs to be built with a programming language and framework that can handle complex operations, system-level interactions, and provide robust performance. The choice of programming language and framework will significantly impact development speed, maintainability, and the system's ability to meet its requirements.

## Key Requirements
- High performance for concurrent operations
- Strong system-level capabilities
- Rich ecosystem of libraries
- Good developer experience
- Strong security features
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Active community and long-term support

## Decision
We will use **Rust** as our primary programming language with the following core framework stack:

- **Tokio**: Async runtime for concurrent operations
- **Axum**: Web framework for API development
- **SQLx**: Database access with compile-time verification
- **Serde**: Serialization/deserialization
- **Tracing**: Observability and logging
- **Clap**: Command-line argument parsing

## Rationale for Rust

### Performance and Safety
- Zero-cost abstractions
- Memory safety without garbage collection
- Thread safety guarantees
- High performance comparable to C/C++
- Strong type system preventing runtime errors

### Ecosystem Advantages
- Excellent package management with Cargo
- Rich ecosystem for infrastructure tools
- Strong container and cloud-native support
- Mature async/await support
- Excellent FFI capabilities

### Developer Experience
- Modern tooling and IDE support
- Clear error messages and compiler guidance
- Built-in testing framework
- Documentation generation
- Strong community support

### Operational Benefits
- Single binary deployment
- No runtime dependencies
- Small memory footprint
- Excellent monitoring and observability
- Cross-platform compilation

### Security Features
- Memory safety by default
- Thread safety guarantees
- No undefined behavior
- Strong type system
- Built-in security best practices

### Long-term Viability
- Backed by Mozilla and growing community
- Used in production by major companies
- Regular updates and improvements
- Strong backward compatibility
- Clear upgrade paths

## Alternative Options Considered

### Go
Pros:
- Simple and easy to learn
- Fast compilation
- Good standard library
- Built-in concurrency

Cons:
- Less type safety
- Limited generics support
- Garbage collection overhead
- Less mature ecosystem for infrastructure tools

### Python
Pros:
- Easy to learn and use
- Rich ecosystem
- Rapid development
- Great for prototyping

Cons:
- Performance limitations
- Dynamic typing risks
- GIL limitations
- Deployment complexity
- Memory usage

### Java/Kotlin
Pros:
- Mature ecosystem
- Strong type system
- Good performance
- Enterprise-ready

Cons:
- JVM overhead
- Larger memory footprint
- Slower startup time
- More complex deployment
- Less suitable for system-level operations

## Consequences

### Positive
- High performance and reliability
- Strong safety guarantees
- Excellent developer experience
- Future-proof technology choice
- Strong community support

### Negative
- Learning curve for team members
- Initial development may be slower
- Need to establish coding standards
- Need to set up CI/CD tooling
- May need to hire Rust developers

## Compliance
- All new code must be written in Rust
- Dependencies must be managed through Cargo
- Regular security audits of dependencies
- Performance benchmarks for critical paths
- Documentation must be kept up to date
- Code must follow Rust best practices
