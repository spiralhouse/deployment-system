# ADR-0006: Integration Strategy

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The deployment system needs to integrate with various external systems to provide a complete solution:
1. Observability platforms for monitoring deployment health and performance
2. Service catalogs for managing service metadata and dependencies
3. Kubernetes providers for actual deployment targets
4. Source code management and CI/CD systems

Each integration category has multiple potential providers, and we need to ensure our system can work effectively with different combinations while maintaining a consistent user experience.

## Decision
We will implement a provider-based integration architecture with the following key components:

### Source Code Management
- Primary focus on GitHub integration
- Support for both monorepo and polyrepo strategies
- Integration with:
  - GitHub Actions for CI
  - GitHub Merge Queues (optional feature)
  - GitHub Apps for authentication and webhooks

### Observability Integration
- Provider-agnostic metrics interface
- Built-in support for:
  - Prometheus (default)
  - DataDog
  - SignalFx
- Extensible provider model for additional platforms
- Standard metrics collection for:
  - Deployment success/failure rates
  - Rollout progress
  - Performance impact
  - Custom SLOs/SLIs

### Service Catalog Integration
- Pluggable catalog provider interface
- Initial support for:
  - Port
  - Backstage
- Standard service metadata model
- Bidirectional sync capabilities
- Support for custom catalog implementations

### Kubernetes Provider Integration
- Cloud provider-agnostic interface
- First-class support for:
  - Amazon EKS
  - Google GKE
  - Others via standard Kubernetes API
- Cluster credential management
- Multi-cluster deployment strategies
- Provider-specific feature detection

## Rationale

### Why GitHub-First?
1. Market dominance and widespread adoption
2. Rich API and webhook support
3. Strong security features
4. Built-in CI/CD capabilities
5. Comprehensive code review features

### Why Provider-Based Architecture?
1. Allows for easy addition of new providers
2. Maintains consistent internal interfaces
3. Enables customer choice without complexity
4. Facilitates testing and validation
5. Supports gradual feature adoption

### Why Standard Interfaces?
1. Reduces integration complexity
2. Enables provider switching
3. Simplifies testing
4. Ensures consistent behavior
5. Facilitates documentation

## Implementation

### Integration Interface Requirements
- Provider-specific configuration
- Health check capabilities
- Error handling and recovery
- Rate limiting and backoff
- Credential management
- Audit logging
- Feature detection

### Standard Integration Patterns
1. **Webhook Handling**
   - Validation
   - Rate limiting
   - Retry logic
   - Error handling

2. **API Communication**
   - Authentication
   - Rate limiting
   - Caching
   - Circuit breaking

3. **State Management**
   - Consistency checks
   - Conflict resolution
   - Recovery procedures

4. **Metric Collection**
   - Standard metric names
   - Common labels
   - Aggregation rules
   - Export formats

## Consequences

### Positive
- Flexible provider choice
- Consistent integration patterns
- Simplified provider onboarding
- Clear extension points
- Reliable testing approach

### Negative
- More complex initial implementation
- Need to maintain provider implementations
- Potential feature limitations
- Additional testing requirements
- Documentation overhead

## Compliance
- All integrations must implement health checks
- Provider configurations must be validated
- Credentials must be securely stored
- Integration status must be monitored
- Failures must be logged and alertable
- Rate limits must be respected
- Metrics must follow naming conventions
- All webhooks must be authenticated
