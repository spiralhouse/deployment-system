# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) that document significant architectural decisions made during the development of the deployment system.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record is a document that captures an important architectural decision, including the context, the decision itself, the status, consequences, and compliance requirements.

## ADR Template

Each ADR follows this template:

```markdown

## Decision
