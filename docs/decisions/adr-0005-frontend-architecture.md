# ADR-0005: Frontend Architecture Selection

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The deployment system requires a user interface for users to:
- View deployment status in real-time
- Provide manual approvals
- View deployment history
- Configure deployment settings
- Monitor system health

We need to decide whether to build a modular monolith where Rust handles both backend and frontend, or adopt a service-oriented architecture with separate frontend and backend services.

## Key Requirements
- Rich, interactive user interface
- Real-time updates for deployment status
- Complex forms and data visualization
- Responsive design
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Easy maintenance and updates
- Efficient development workflow
- Access to mature UI components and libraries

## Decision
We will adopt a service-oriented architecture with:
- Backend services written in Rust (as per ADR-0004)
- Separate frontend service using TypeScript and React
- RESTful API communication between services
- WebSocket for real-time updates

### Frontend Technology Stack
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience
- **React**: For building interactive user interfaces
- **Next.js**: For server-side rendering and optimal performance
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and responsive design
- **React Query**: For efficient data fetching and caching
- **Socket.io-client**: For real-time updates
- **React Hook Form**: For form handling
- **Zod**: For runtime type validation

## Rationale

### Why Service-Oriented Architecture?
1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Backend focuses on deployment logic and system operations
   - Frontend focuses on user interaction and experience
   - Each service can evolve independently

2. **Development Efficiency**
   - Faster UI development with established tools
   - Parallel development of frontend and backend
   - Easier to maintain and update each service

3. **Technology Flexibility**
   - Can leverage best-in-class tools for each domain
   - Easier to adopt new frontend technologies
   - Better access to UI components and libraries

4. **Team Organization**
   - Can hire specialized developers
   - Clear ownership of components
   - Easier onboarding for new team members

### Why TypeScript and React?
1. **TypeScript Benefits**
   - Type safety and better IDE support
   - Catch errors at compile time
   - Better maintainability
   - Improved developer experience

2. **React Benefits**
   - Large ecosystem of components
   - Strong community support
   - Excellent developer tools
   - Reusable component architecture
   - Virtual DOM for performance

3. **Next.js Benefits**
   - Server-side rendering
   - API routes
   - Built-in routing
   - Optimized performance
   - Easy deployment

## Alternative Options Considered

### Modular Monolith with Rust Frontend
Pros:
- Single codebase and deployment
- Shared types and business logic
- Simpler deployment and maintenance
- No cross-service communication overhead
- Consistent tooling and development experience

Cons:
- Rust's web UI ecosystem is less mature
- Fewer UI components and libraries
- Harder to hire developers
- Less flexibility in technology choices
- Potentially slower UI development

### Vue.js Alternative
Pros:
- Lighter weight than React
- Simpler learning curve
- Good documentation
- Strong community

Cons:
- Smaller ecosystem than React
- Fewer enterprise-level components
- Less corporate backing
- Fewer job candidates

## Consequences

### Positive
- Faster UI development
- Better developer experience
- Access to mature UI ecosystem
- Easier to hire developers
- More flexible architecture
- Better separation of concerns

### Negative
- More complex deployment
- Need to handle cross-service communication
- Potential consistency issues
- More infrastructure to manage
- Multiple codebases to maintain
- Need to establish API contracts

## Compliance
- Frontend must be written in TypeScript
- React components must follow functional patterns
- All API endpoints must be documented
- Real-time updates must use WebSocket
- UI must be responsive and accessible
- Code must follow React best practices
- TypeScript strict mode must be enabled
- All components must have unit tests
- API contracts must be versioned
- Frontend must handle offline scenarios
